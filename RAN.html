<br>In the begining of this trainings,<br> we are going to pass eyes throught everything behind the modern communication that is enjoyed today.<br>
<b>The word Telecommunication</b> means communication along the long distance between two or more peaple.<br>
Normally, telecommunication tower is made up by three main parts.(but here we will deal with only two).<br><br><br>
<b>RAN (Radio Access Network)</b> as it is called, it is the part of the tower that is <br>responsible for controlling
<br>the communication between the tower and the user.<br><br>This part is composed by the equipments like, RF antenna, RRU/RUG/RUS, Baseband, DUG, DUW,TCU and all the cables taken as the connectors between them.<br><br>
<b>RF Antenna</b> this is the types of antenna which has ability to communicate with the devices that can accept Radio Frequencies.<br>
as the tower is transceiver, this antenna has ability to transmit and receive signals from/to the user.<br>
It is divided into many types such as <b>Single-band, Dual-band, Triple-band, Quad-band, Hex-band, among others.</b><br><br>
<b>RRU(Remote Radio Unity</b> This is the type of radio which is used to generate<br>
the network based on the band of frequencies specified either 2g,3g,4g.<br> It is divided into types like <b>B1(u21) </b>
with the ability to generate 3g(UMTS) network at frequency of 2100 mhz. <br>
<b>B3(g18) </b> with the ability to generate 2G(GSM) Network at frequency of 1800 mhz.<br>
<b>B8(Both 2G & 3G)</b> it is able to specify both 2g and 3g networks at frequency of 900 mhz.<br>
<img src="rru.jpg" height="320px" width="400px"><br>
both RRU and RF antenna are connected together by the cables called<b>Jumpers.</b><br>By not talking much about OTher radios like RUS & RUG,<br>
They are similar to RRU, Except that RUS and RUG are indoor radios , means that they can be affected by outside Environmental <br> conditions like
Rain. The other difference is that RRU can be accessed remotely but RUS and RUG can't.<br><br>
<b>The other part is Baseband </b> this is the main controler of all parts of RAN at the tower. it manages the flow of signals by the site(BTS: Base Station Controller).<br>
it is used to specify the kind of network needed on site. the difference btn Baseband, DUG & DUW is that <br>
some basebands can operate on all types of network had on site .for example, Baseband 6630. DUG and DUW
work closely like Basebsnd but the difference is that DUG <br>
operates only on 2g networks and DUW operates only on 3g Networks.<br> the interface between Baseband/DUG/DUW and RRU/RUS/RUG is Fiber optic cables.
